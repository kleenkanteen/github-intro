    I'm Sabih. I have ideas and try to (painstakingly) bring them to life. The ability to create impact and the creativity of programming is what excites me. To learn more about me, check out this <a href="https://github.com/kleenkanteen/about-me-in-5-minutes">5 minute article I wrote about myself.</a>

  <h2>What I'm up to now</h2>
    <div align="left">
      <p>Last updated Feb 28, 2024:</p>
      <p>Jumping from hackathon to hackathon and project to project, haha. About to finish 3. 1 of them uses satellite imagery for farm soil analysis, the other uses maps and creates a walking distance buffer.</p>
    <p>I have another carpooling idea that is not of the 3 mentionued. I call it <a href="https://ant-ride-1dvw.vercel.app/" target="_blank">ant ride</a>. The easiest way to organize carpooling for one-off or weekly events by automating groups based on location. And no login needed. The few existing websites lack these features.</p>
    <p>The frontend for ant ride is almost complete. Will finish it as soon as I finish up the 3 mentioned since those are 80% complete.</p>

  <h2 style="font-weight: bold">3 things I did:</h2>
  <ul align="left">
    <li><a href="https://dtogether.ca" target="_blank">dtogether.ca</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kleenkanteen/dtogether.ca-backend">code</a>: A marketplace for diabetics to sell excess supplies. Frontend deployed on Vercel, backend on Railway. Built using a open source marketplace platform called Medusa. Inspired after becoming type 1 diabetic myself and seeing other sell supplies using a Facebook group instead of a proper website.</li>
    <li><a href="https://learn-react-e4942.web.app/" target="_blank">Twitter clone</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kleenkanteen/twitter-clone">code</a>: A crude twitter clone. Used this to learn React and Firebase.</li>
    <li><a href="https://toronto-intersection-risk.netlify.app" target="_blank">Toronto intersection risk map</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kleenkanteen/HackTo2022Hive">code</a>: Made in a hackathon in a team of 3. This takes historical accident data of Toronto intersections and plots each by danger level. What I did:
      <ul>
        <li>Helped plot the points from the JSON data onto the Leaflet map.</li>
        <li>Set a minimum goal for the team that allowed us to have something presentable.</li>
        <li>Deployed the website on Vercel</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>
