    Hi!

  <p>
    I'm Sabih. I have ideas and try to (painstakingly) bring them to life. The ability to create impact and the creativity of programming is what excites me. To learn more about me, check out this <a href="https://github.com/kleenkanteen/about-me-in-5-minutes">5 minute article I wrote about myself.</a>
  </p>
  <h2 style="font-weight: bold">3 things I did:</h2>
  <ul align="left">
    <li><a href="https://dtogether.ca" target="_blank">dtogether.ca</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kleenkanteen/dtogether.ca-backend">code</a>: A marketplace for diabetics to sell excess supplies. Frontend deployed on Vercel, backend on Railway. Built using a open source marketplace platform called Medusa. Inspired after becoming type 1 diabetic myself and seeing other sell supplies using a Facebook group instead of a proper website.</li>
    <li><a href="https://learn-react-e4942.web.app/" target="_blank">Twitter clone</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kleenkanteen/twitter-clone">code</a>: A crude twitter clone. Used this to learn React and Firebase.</li>
    <li><a href="https://toronto-intersection-risk.netlify.app" target="_blank">Toronto intersection risk map</a>, <a href="toronto-intersection-risk.netlify.app">code</a>: Made in a hackathon in a team of 3. This takes historical accident data of Toronto intersections and plots each by danger level. What I did:
      <ul>
        <li>Helped plot the points from the JSON data onto the Leaflet map.</li>
        <li>Set a minimum goal for the team that allowed us to have something presentable.</li>
        <li>Deployed the website on Vercel</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>
  <h2>What I'm up to now</h2>
    <div align="left">
    <p>The problem: People have trouble finding a family doctor accepting patients. They are waiting a couple months or years just to find one, this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ontario/comments/13gyspu/need_a_family_doctor/">reddit post for example</a>.</p>  The government solution is to sign up to wait in this <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/find-family-doctor-or-nurse-practitioner#section-1">list</a>. It's too slow because because the nurses/people who run it have to manually call and keep track of which doctors are free. Instead, a faster way is for you to go to the source by calling clinics the family doctors work at and asking whose free. But that will take forever to call each clinic.

    <div align="left">
      <p>My solution: Make a robocaller using Twilio to call clinics every month asking if any family doctors are accepting patients. I gather and show this on a public website. The latest data, easily accessible.</p>
