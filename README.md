  <p>
    I'm Sabih. I have many ideas inspired from my daily life and observations. What excites me about building functional software is the ability to create impact and the thinking involved when programming. If you want to learn more about me, check out this <a target="_blank" href="https://dub.sh/about-me">5 minute article I wrote.</a>

  <h2>What I'm up to now</h2>
    <div align="left">
      <p>Last updated Apr 18, 2024:</p>
      <p>Finishing up a hackathon project for a LLM idea I had that saves interesting posts you came across online. I have another carpooling idea one the side as well called <a href="https://dub.sh/ant-ride-github" target="_blank">ant ride</a>. I want to make it the easiest way to organize       carpooling for one-off or weekly events by auto-matching carpooling groups based on location. Plus no login needed. The few existing websites lack this simplicity.</p>
    <p>The frontend for ant ride is 70% complete. Backend is 30% done. Need to connect them together. Will try to finish it soon.</p>

  <h2 style="font-weight: bold">3 projects I made before:</h2>
  <ul align="left">
    <li>
      <span>March 2024: </span><a href="https://farmware-xi.vercel.app/" target="_blank">farmware.app</a>, <a href="https://github.com/giridhar7632/farmware">code</a>: A website for farmers to visualize soil moisture on their farms using open satellite imagery. Won best startup idea for the Convex       (backend as a service) hackathon. Sentinel-2 satellite images from the European Space Agency were used through their API. The normalized moisture index (NDMI) was calculated from the satellite data. Built this with 2 other nifty teammates.
    </li>
    <li>Jan 2024: <a href="https://lablab.ai/event/nextgen-gpt-ai-hackathon/jarvis/ai-project-manager-assistant" target="_blank">AI Project Manager Assistant</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kleenkanteen/ai-project-manager-assistant">code</a>: A slack bot assistant for project/product managers. Allows them to get zoom meeting summaries sent to them over slack. The bot has the ability to store past meeting transcriptions + summaries using Supabase (hosted Postgres). Can
write a slack command to list the meeting summaries of today. Team of 2.</li>
    <li><span>June 2023: </span><a href="https://dtogether.ca" target="_blank">dtogether.ca</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kleenkanteen/dtogether.ca-backend">code</a>: A secondhand marketplace for diabetics, especially type 1 like myself, to sell excess supplies. This could include insulin pump or glucose sensor supplies. Frontend deployed on Vercel, backend on Railway. Built using a open source marketplace platform called Medusa. Inspired after becoming type 1 diabetic myself and seeing others sell hundreds of dollars worth of supplies at 50-70% discounts inside an active <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1087611668259945/" target="_blank">facebook group</a>, instead of a proper marketplace. I made a very basic, non-functional version of a marketplace before I called quits because of how much work it would be to make it work and convince everyone to switch. Nice intro though to using an open source framework like Medusa and learning from others in the Medusa discord server.
