    I'm Sabih. I have many ideas inspired from my daily observations that I want to bring to life. What excites me about building functional software? The ability to create impact and the creativity of programming. If you want to learn more about me, check out this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sabih.me/posts/about-me-in-5-minutes/">5 minute article.</a>

  <h2>What I'm up to now</h2>
    <div align="left">
      <p>Last updated Mar 15, 2024:</p>
      <p>Finishing up a hackathon project that uses satellite imagery for farm soil analysis. Also joined and am working on 2 other long term projects with 2 different people. One is a classroom programming education website. The other is an all-in-one productivity tool.</p>
    <p>I have another carpooling idea that is not of the 3 mentioned, called <a href="https://ant-ride-1dvw.vercel.app/" target="_blank">ant ride</a>. I hope to make it the easiest way to organize carpooling for one-off or weekly events by automating carpooling groups based on location. Plus no login needed. The few existing websites lack this simplicity.</p>
    <p>The frontend for ant ride is 80% complete. Backend is 20% done. Need to hook them up together. Will try to finish it this march..</p>

  <h2 style="font-weight: bold">3 projects I made before:</h2>
  <ul align="left">
    <li><span>June 2023: </span><a href="https://dtogether.ca" target="_blank">dtogether.ca</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kleenkanteen/dtogether.ca-backend">code</a>: A marketplace for diabetics to sell excess supplies. Frontend deployed on Vercel, backend on Railway. Built using a open source marketplace platform called Medusa. Inspired after becoming type 1 diabetic myself and seeing other sell supplies using a Facebook group instead of a proper website.</li>
    <li>May 2023: <a href="https://learn-react-e4942.web.app/" target="_blank">Twitter clone</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kleenkanteen/twitter-clone">code</a>: A crude twitter clone. Used this to learn React and Firebase.</li>
    <li>Sep 2022: <a href="https://toronto-intersection-risk.netlify.app" target="_blank">Toronto intersection risk map</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kleenkanteen/HackTo2022Hive">code</a>: Made in a hackathon in a team of 3. This takes historical accident data of Toronto intersections and plots each by danger level. What I did:
      <ul>
        <li>Helped plot the points from the JSON data onto the Leaflet map.</li>
        <li>Set a minimum goal for the team that allowed us to have something presentable.</li>
        <li>Deployed the website on Vercel</li>
      </ul>
      <li>And many more, blog post of everything coming soon!</li>
  </ul>
